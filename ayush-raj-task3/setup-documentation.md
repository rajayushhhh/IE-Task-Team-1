### What is Hardhat and Why Do We Use It?

**Hardhat** is a tool that helps to **build, test, and deploy smart contracts** locally for testing and debugging.

We use it because it lets us test contracts **locally** and run tests with simple commands, also it helps with finding and fixing **errors**

### 2. Understanding the Setup

---

#### 📁 What Files Are Automatically Generated by Hardhat?

After setup these were the files :
 hello-vpn-contract/
│
├── contracts/
│ └── Counter.sol
│
├── scripts/
│ └── send-op-tx.ts
│
├── test/
│ └── Counter.ts
│
├── node_modules
├── hardhat.config.js (or hardhat.config.ts)
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json


---

#### 🗂️ Purpose of Each Folder

- **`contracts/`** — This is where we write our contracts.  
 

- **`scripts/`** — This folder contains our deployment scripts.  


- **`test/`** — This folder is for testing your contracts.  

---

#### ⚙️ What is `hardhat.config.ts`?

`hardhat.config.ts` is the configuration file of our Hardhat project.  
It tells Hardhat which version to use, which network to deploy and any other custom settings.
